Old Dreamweaver Extensions
==========================

For those still using Dreamweaver CS3 and below, these are the old extensions that I created to be used with them.
These were created when PHP support in Dreamweaver was minimal.

I am not sure if they will still work with CS4, CS5 or CS6 but you can try them and let me know if they work.

Included are:
-------------

* format_mysql_local.mxp
* nochex_mini_suite.mxp
* page_transitions.mxp
* php_detail_pages.mxp
* php_dynamic_email.mxp
* php_dynamic_image.mxp 
* php_dynamic_title.mxp
* php_dynamic_web.mxp
* php_format_mysql.mxp
* php_hide_empty.mxp
* php_random_record.mxp
* php_whats_new.mxp
